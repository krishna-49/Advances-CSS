    <p class="intro">
        Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. One day, Jack’s mother told him to sell their only
        cow.
        Jack went to the market and on the way he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. Jack asked, “What will you give
        me in
        return for my cow?” The man answered, “I will give you five magic beans!” Jack took the magic beans and gave the
        man
        the cow. But when he reached home, Jack’s mother was very angry. She said, “You fool! He took away your cow and
        gave
        you some beans!” She threw the beans out of the window. Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.
    </p>

    <p>The next day, when Jack woke up in the morning and looked out of the window, he saw that a huge beanstalk had
        grown from his magic beans! He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. There lived a giant
        and his wife. Jack went inside the house and found the giant’s wife in the kitchen. Jack said, “Could you please
        give me something to eat? I am so hungry!” The kind wife gave him bread and some milk.</p>

    <p>While he was eating, the giant came home. The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. Jack was terrified and
        went and hid inside. The giant cried, “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he
        dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” So, the giant ate his
        food and then went to his room. He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. Then he
        went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, took one sack of gold coins and climbed down
        the beanstalk. At home, he gave the coins to his mother. His mother was very happy and they lived well for
        sometime.</p>
